# Welcome to arXiv Bot! ðŸ¤–

This personal project is a demo of the arXiv Research Assistant. It is meant to help me keep up with the latest research in the fast-growing space of AI and LLMs. It is capable of retrieving relevant papers from arXiv and parsing the full-text to extract relevant information based on your query. You can check out the project in my [Github repo](https://github.com/raihanfadhilah/arxiv-chatbot)! 

## Usage
There are two ways you can use the chatbot:

1. Upload papers of interest and immediately ask specific questions about some information contained in the paper.


2. Use the built-in search functionality to retrieve relevant papers from the arXiv database based on a user query. Note that to optimize the query, please phrase the question such that arXiv IDs or titles of papers of interest are clearly noted in the query. 

    Example query: In the paper "Attention is All You Need", how do positional embeddings work?

    After the relevant papers are retrieved, more specifc questions can be asked.
