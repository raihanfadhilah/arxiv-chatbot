\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec.conclusion}
In this work, we presented \system, an automatic, self-supervised, and scalable timeseries analytics tool. \system effectively adapts Transformer, popular in NLP, into timeseries analytics. 
As the key component of \system, group attention eliminates the performance bottleneck of the classical self-attention mechanisms, thus successfully scaling \system to highly complex, long timeseries data.
Our experiments confirm that \system significantly speeds up the state-of-the-art by 63X with a better accuracy.
